Barry is a lightweight, low-ceremony, ready-to-use boiler-plate Sinatra-based Ruby web-app API BE based on principles of extreme minimalism and optimized for Developer Happiness.

## Design Principles & Features

* BE as API, agnostic to client, accepts and returns JSON.
* [NoSQL]-DB-as-model - no models in code, DB is source of truth.
* Statelessness of UX session; state is managed in client, data is managed in server. 
* Client-oriented routes over pure RESTfulness 
* Code minimalism. Empty lines tell no bugs or maintenance.
* Optimizing for developer happiness!
